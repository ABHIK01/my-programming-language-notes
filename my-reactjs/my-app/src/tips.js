top down approch - when know most of compoent
function compoentsnt - nzouser actino - not a top levle/ no state
class commentny- state, top, and envet hanlders


data in
	instance property
	internal state object - if we need to re-render everytime data is changed
	
every reacct event funciton, has event argument (wrapper around native event argument)

ref property of an element, takes funciton with reference to wlwement when the element is mounted
	<input type="text"
		ref = {(input1) => this.userNameInput=input1}
		/>

controlled compoennts
	method - o control input (rather than reading form dom)
	more code but better than ref

add key when creating a array/ map

    encapsurte js into resuable module that can be referenced by other modues
        commonjs pattern module definition
            nodejs javascipt files follows commonjs pattern (for reference and exporting modules)
            // get reference to dependency      var dep = require('/pathtofile')
            // declare module                   var mod1 {}

browserify      expose node packages to browser - bundles node modules for use in browser, by default bundles all dependenciess into a single file (minimizes no. of requests)
facebook react  view engine, components library  - packaging, composing, rendering html components - composing many components together - virtual dom, so very fast, when ui changes  compares state in memory  and renders on real dom,  virtual dom helps  client-side and server-side rendering (vdom differentiates angular and knockout)
react/router    to handle client-side routing (inspired by ember)

                                    model - storing and retrieving application data
                                    view - presentational piece of the applicationâ€“what the end-user sees
                                    controller - transforms data from a model so that it can be presented via the view
                                        model & view talk through controller
                                        controller has greater responsibility/complexity, maintain app state, and act as mediator between view and model
                            
                            auto-bind user interface changes to changes in the data model, and vice versa
                                M<->C<->V
                                model is not connect to controller, but to the view
                                app state is modified by two sources - both controller and model - more or less bypassing the controller
                                    current state of the application is no longer predictable
                            unidirectional application architecture
